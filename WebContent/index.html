                <p class="content-body"> White Sands National Park is an American national park located in the state of New Mexico on U.S.
                    Route 70 approximately 15 miles (24 km) southwest of Alamogordo and 52 miles (84 km) northeast of
                    Las Cruces, in western Otero County and northeastern DoÃ±a Ana County.
                    The park is situated at an average elevation of about 4,000 feet (1,219 m) in the Tularosa Basin and
                    comprises the southern part of a 275 sq mi (710 km2) field of white sand dunes composed of gypsum
                    crystals. The gypsum dunefield is the largest of its kind on Earth.</p>

                <p class="content-body">A fossil trackway of footprints of humans and ground sloths found at White Sands and dating from the
                    last ice age shows that ground sloths were hunted by humans at least 11,700 years ago.
                    Paleo-Indians inhabited the shoreline of Lake Otero, a large lake that covered much of the Tularosa
                    Basin.
                    They used stone from the mountains to create projectile points, known as Folsom and Plano points,
                    and attached them to spears for hunting mammoths, camels, ground sloths, and bison.
                    Projectile points and stone tools have been found in the basin associated with ancient shorelines,
                    streams, and hills.
                    As the large ice sheet that capped the North American continent receded, Lake Otero began to
                    evaporate, leaving behind Alkali Flat and Lake Lucero.
                    The grassland died and the basin became increasingly arid, slowly changing into desert scrubland.
                    The megafauna disappeared from the basin leaving behind fossil footprints.</p>
